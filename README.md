A mockup of a "blog" style website

# How the project went
The hardest part was to think of the idea and overall style of the webpage.
After that the direction of this project was quite clear and I was able to
complete it in a few hours.

# What I learned
I learned the "Flexbox" layout model, revised basic HTML and CSS syntax and
learned to plan the layout ahead. 10 minutes of planning saves hours of frustration.

# What I would do differently
I would split my css into different files (e.g. one for text, another for header, third for content ect.). Since I completed the project in one day I had an idea of where to find which
CSS setting, however, after a week I would get lost in the CSS code.
